Located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is commonly known as the largest in the world for its impressive <br> 
sheet of rapidly falling water. These falls are iconic, and many visitors to Africa take a special journey to Zambia or Zimbabwe just <br>
to take in views described as “once in a lifetime” by many. The temperate year-round weather around Victoria Falls only adds to  <br>
its popularity. However, summers can be hot and too dry to see the falls in full form, making the best views under the clearest skies <br>
between March and August.</p>
